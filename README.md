# SMRenderer
A 2D-renderer-preset for OpenTK/C#

## First things first
I am not a master or professional OpenGL user, more the exact oppisite. I currently learn how to use OpenTK and this project is my learning project.

## What is that?
This project is a open preset for OpenTK. This preset come with a working animation system, timer and interval system, preset shaders, texture intergation, easy camera control and a simple way to render stuff in a 2D-space.

As you can see, you won't get a .dll file, instead you get the entire project. The idea is, that you can add as much as you like. (or remove, if needed)

## Installation guide
1: Get (Download/Clone) the repo

Visual Studio:

2: Put the folder in your solution.

3: Create a reference to the VisualStudio-project file inside the folder

Other:

2: Put the folder in your project.

3: You should now be able to access it, thourgh the SMRenderer-namespace

Thats it. Thanks for using it.

## I've found a more effective way to do sh. | I've created a new feature that I wanted to share.
Cool. You can tell me more about it and if I think, that is a good addition, I will add it and credit you, ofcause.
